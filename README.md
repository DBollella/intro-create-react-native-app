# intro-create-react-native-app
Slides for my Intro to React Native with create-react-native-app talk

These slides were created using [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle).
You can watch it in presentation mode [here](https://intro-create-react-native-app.now.sh).

This talk was given at the [React SP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-SP/events/240212915/) and it was recorded.
I'll post the link to the recording as soon as it is available.
